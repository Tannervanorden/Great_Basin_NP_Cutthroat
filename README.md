# Great_Basin_NP_Cutthroat
This is a repository full of code used for population genetic analysese and corresponding figures made following this tutorial "https://github.com/nt246/lcwgs-guide-tutorial" using low coverage whole genomes from Great Basin National Park Bonneville cutthroat trout. Nulceotide diversity(π) values were calculated from angsd Thetastat and was read into a csv file using angsdr.

Nucleotide_Diversity_RGraphs.R was used to calculate nucleotide diversity(π) according to instructions found in the tutorial. 

Hendrys.py is the graph of historical compared to modern nucleotide diversity(π) in Hendry's Creek.

Mill.py is the graph of historical compared to modern nucleotide diversity(π) in Mill Creek.

Orginal.py is the graph of all populations and their modern nucleotide diversity(π)

Original_Willard_Rainbow_Yellow.R is the PCA plot of all original populations compared to Yellowstone cutthroat trout and rainbow trout.

High_Diversity_PCA_Unedited.R is the PCA plot of all high diversity populations compared to Great Basin National Park stocking sources.

FST_HeatMap.R was used to create the heat map of FST values of different Bonneville cutthroat trout populations.

Heterozygosity.R is an example file that was used to calculate heterozygosity. This was following the tutorial found here "https://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Heterozygosity"
