# Great_Basin_NP_Cutthroat
This is a repository full of code for figures made using data generated using this tutorial "https://github.com/nt246/lcwgs-guide-tutorial" using low coverage whole genomes from Great Basin National Park Bonneville cutthroat trout. Nulceotide diversity(π) values were calculated from angsd Thetastat and was read into a csv file using angsdr.
