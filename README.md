# Great_Basin_NP_Cutthroat
This is a repository full of code for figures made using data generated using this tutorial "https://github.com/nt246/lcwgs-guide-tutorial" using low coverage whole genomes from Great Basin National Park Bonneville cutthroat trout. Nulceotide diversity(π) values were calculated from angsd Thetastat and was read into a csv file using angsdr.

Nucleotide_Diversity_RGraphs.R was used to calculate nucleotide diversity(π) according to instructions found in the tutorial. 
Hendrys.py is the graph of historical compared to modern nucleotide diversity(π) in Hendry's Creek.
Mill.py is the graph of historical compared to modern nucleotide diversity(π) in Mill Creek.
Orginal.py is the graph of all populations and their modern nucleotide diversity(π)
